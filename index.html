                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">What is Scrum?</h6>
                    <p class="card-text">Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together, and to get work done. It is a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and getting them done, implementing them into the program allowing the client to use the program even though it’s not complete. Agile is a set of values and principles. Much of the discussion around Agile has to do with following different practices, using various methodologies, and even developing with specific tools. While these things might help a team that is trying to follow Agile, they aren’t Agile in and of themselves. Agile is really a collection of beliefs that teams can use for making decisions about how to do the work for developing software. Agile doesn't make decisions for you, instead it gives a foundation that teams can use to make decisions that result in better software development.</p>
                    <h5 class="card-title">Sprints</h5>
                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">What are Sprints?</h6>
                    <p class="card-text">A sprint is a short, time-boxed period where a Scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. They are at the very heart of Scrum and Agile methodologies. A product is typically built in a series of iterations that break down big complex projects into smaller pieces. This makes projects more manageable, allows teams to ship high quality work faster and more frequently and gives them more flexibility to adapt and change. This is what a sprint is. Sprint helps teams to follow the agile principle of “delivering working software frequently” as well as live the agile value of “responding to change over following a plan.”</p>
                    <h5 class="card-title">Sprint Planning</h5>
                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">What is Sprint Planning?</h6>
                    <p class="card-text">Sprint planning, as the name suggests, is used to plan an upcoming sprint. Sprint planning is typically the first step in Scrum which creates the starting line for a sprint by setting the agenda and focal point. Sprint planning is a collaborative event where a number of things are decided. During sprint planning, the team answers some questions: What work can get done in this sprint (what is the sprint goal) and how will the chosen work get done? How long is the time box going to be? What is the starting point for the planned sprint going to be?</p>
                    <h5 class="card-title">Retrospectives</h5>
                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">What are Retrospectives?</h6>
                    <p class="card-text">A retrospective is anytime the team reflects on the past in order to improve and have more success in the future. It is simply a process of looking back at previous work experiences, the results which came from them and how you can learn from them to improve on upcoming work.</p>
